\chapter{State of the Art}\label{chap:state_of_the_art}
In this chapter, we give a general introduction into Crowdsourcing and continue by describing its relevance in the Semantic Web area. Next, we discuss the existing approach of ontology validation using Crowdsourcing where this thesis is based on. This chapter ends with alternative approaches which add context to Crowdsourcing tasks to get better results.
