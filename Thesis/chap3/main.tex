\chapter{Context Enrichment Methods}\label{chap:context_enrichment_methods}
In this chapter we describe our approaches of generating context descriptions in detail. All described approaches do not rely on some pre-defined settings or data, instead they are applicable to general purpose ontologies as well as specialised ones of arbitrary size.

In this chapter, we present three context enrichment methods for ontology validation. While the first one~(\hyperref[sec:enrichment_ontology_approach]{\textbf{Ontology~based~Approach}}), introduced in \hyperref[sec:neighboring_nodes]{Section~\ref*{sec:neighboring_nodes}}, takes neighbouring nodes~(i.e. subclass relations) into account, the second one~(\hyperref[sec:enrichment_metaData_approach]{\textbf{Metadata based Approach}}), discussed in \hyperref[sec:embedded_context]{Section~\ref*{sec:embedded_context}}, is based on embedded context and the last one~(\hyperref[sec:enrichment_dictionary_approach]{\textbf{Dictionary based Approach}}), explained in \hyperref[sec:external_source]{Section~\ref*{sec:external_source}}, uses external sources as input for enrichment.
