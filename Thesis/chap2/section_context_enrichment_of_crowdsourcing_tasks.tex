\section{The use of Context in Crowdsourcing Tasks}
% Notes from meeting with MS:

% -) In related work, consider the use of context (e.g. define what "Context" means --> see definition from MS)

\subsection{Context}
When analysing the use of context enriched crowdsourcing tasks, we noticed that there exists no formal definition of that term. Instead, all approaches that were found use a different notion of context. 
This section first investigates what definitions of context these approaches were used. After that, we give a consolidated definition of context that fits our approach of crowd-based ontology validation.
