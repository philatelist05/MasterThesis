\section{Tennis Ontology}\label{sec:result_t_ontology}
In this section, results from the crowd-sourced ontology validation in the domain of tennis are presented. A detailed discussion of the ontology used as a baseline for all calculations was done previously in \hyperref[sec:evaluation_datasets]{Section~\ref*{sec:evaluation_datasets}}.

The worker performance for this dataset was the highest among all evaluated ontologies. In fact, for the highest ranked method~\emph{(Metadata~based~Approach)} at least 2 out of 5 contributors correctly identified relevant concepts or declined unrelated ones. This corresponds to a Precision of $0.896$ and Recall of $0.976$, or combined F-Measure of $0.934$. A detailed comparison of all methods for this dataset is given in~\hyperref[table:bench_p_r_f_tennis]{Table~\ref*{table:bench_p_r_f_tennis}}. Interestingly, the \emph{Dictionary~based~Approach} performed worse than omitting concept descriptions at all. This, we noticed by the high discrepancy of Precision. More precisely, $0.648$ with descriptions constructed from WordNik consultation~\emph{(Dictionary~based~Approach)} compared to $0.783$ without any context.

\hyperref[fig:hist_agreement_tennis_all]{Figure~\ref*{fig:hist_agreement_tennis_all}} depicts the distribution of the agreement ratio among all validated concepts. To the contrary, by the \emph{Ontology~based~Approach}, crowd workers reached the most consensus, albeit being wrong in some cases. They declined 2 relevant concepts whereas for the \emph{Metadata~based~Approach} there were at least 2 of them who were correct for any concept.

\end{sidewaysfigure}

The observations from above were also reflected by the bar plots in~\hyperref[fig:hist_level_tennis_all]{Figure~\ref*{fig:hist_level_tennis_all}}. 
There were no judgments on level $-5$ and $-3$ for the \emph{Metadata~based~Approach}.
The summary statistics in~\hyperref[table:level_corr_incorr_tennis]{Table~\ref*{table:level_corr_incorr_tennis}} confirm that finding. Based on the agreement level and correct/incorrect judgement ratio, the rankings of each method were preserved.
