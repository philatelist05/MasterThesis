% At this point I want to thank all the people who supported me during my studies and during the writing of this thesis.

%First I want to thank my advisor Professor Stefan Biffl for the opportunity to write this diploma thesis. A big thank you goes to Marta Sabou, for supporting me during this whole time with her positive attitude and by giving me the right feedback and advice when I needed it most.

%This is also where I want to be grateful for my family and loved ones, who were with me all along this journey and without them this would not be possible. Thanks to my mother, father and brother, for always being there for me and giving me strength and stability during all this time and supporting me in every decision I make. Thanks to my girlfriend for standing by my side when times where tough and for ensuring me that I can do this.

%Thanks to my friends for reminding me that I can always count on you in times when I need you and that life is also about enjoyment and company. There is not enough room to express my gratefulness to all of you, but be assured that I am thankful for everyone who walked with me on this journey.

First,
