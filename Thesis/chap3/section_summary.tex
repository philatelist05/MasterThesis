\section{Summary}\label{sec:approaches_summary}
In this chapter we investigated three approaches that generate descriptions for selected concepts. The motivation was

were integrated as an extension of the platform which facilitates comparability of crowd worker performance described extensively in
the~\hyperref[chap:results]{Results Chapter}.
