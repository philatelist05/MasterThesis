First and foremost I am grateful for the support from my family, both financially and mentally. Special thanks goes to my mother Christa and father Willibald for always being there for me and giving me the strength and stability during the writing period, especially in those situations where I would otherwise give up.

Next, I want to thank my advisor Stefan Biffl and his assistance Marta Sabou for the opportunity to write this diploma thesis. As a side note, the inspiration for this thesis was actually from a seminar course I took some time ago with some of my colleagues. That was the time where I met Stefan Biffl. He showed me all the details of writing scientific texts. Most importantly, I really liked his structured and organised way of thinking and working. 

Last, I want to thank all contributors from Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States of America who took part in our Crowdsourcing experiment.
