\section{Aim of the Work}
When investigating the use of Context in Crowdsourcing tasks the first question that arise is, what is actually
meant by the term \guillemotright Context\guillemotleft~. Besides referring to the need of Context to improve the understanding
of Crowdsourcing tasks~\cite{sarasua2015crowdsourcing}, not much literature exist yet that exclusively targets this topic. An overview
of existing work as well as a conclusive definition of Context is given in~\hyperref[sec:the_use_of_context_in_crowdsourcing]{Section~\ref*{sec:the_use_of_context_in_crowdsourcing}}.
