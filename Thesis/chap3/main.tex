\chapter{Context Enrichment Methods}\label{chap:context_enrichment_methods}
While in~\hyperref[chap:conceptual_architecture]{Chapter~\ref*{chap:conceptual_architecture}} the technical foundation for implementing the context enrichment methods was built, this chapter describes these on a more conceptual level. All approaches of context enrichment in this chapter do not rely on some pre-defined settings or data, instead they are applicable to general purpose ontologies as well as specialised ones of arbitrary size.

In this chapter, we present three context enrichment methods for ontology validation. While the first one, introduced in \hyperref[sec:neighboring_nodes]{Section~\ref*{sec:neighboring_nodes}}, takes neighbouring nodes~(i.e. subclass relations) into account, the second one, discussed in \hyperref[sec:embedded_context]{Section~\ref*{sec:embedded_context}}, is based on embedded context and the last one, explained in \hyperref[sec:external_source]{Section~\ref*{sec:external_source}}, uses external sources.
