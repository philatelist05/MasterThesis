\chapter{Context Enrichment Methods}\label{chap:context_enrichment_methods}
While in~\hyperref[chap:implementation]{Chapter~\ref*{chap:implementation}} the technical foundation for implementing the Context Enrichment Methods was built, this Chapter describes these on a more conceptual level. There was no limitation on the used settings or data. Instead, the context used for ontology validation was created from general purpose internal and external sources. 

First, \hyperref[sec:neighboring_nodes]{Section~\ref*{sec:neighboring_nodes}} introduces a novel Context Enrichment Method which takes neighboring nodes~(i.e. subclass relations) into account. Second, a method of embedded context using metadata is discussed in \hyperref[sec:embedded_context]{Section~\ref*{sec:embedded_context}} and last, \hyperref[sec:external_source]{Section~\ref*{sec:external_source}} contains Context Enrichment using data from external sources.
\section{Neighboring Nodes}\label{sec:neighboring_nodes}
This Section starts with an conceptual overview of how neighboring nodes in an ontology graph are used to generate contextual information for ontology validation. Then, existing approaches on generating textual definitions for an ontology are examined. As in the literature~\cite{soton265735} the term \textit{ontology verbalisation} is commonly used as a short-term for that task, it is used in the remainder of this Section. We conclude that even though that there exists the major tool \textit{OWL Verbalizer}\footnote{\url{http://mcs.open.ac.uk/nlg/SWAT/Verbaliser.html} accessed 2018/04/30} which transforms a generic OWL~ontology into english sentences, we could not integrate it into Context Enrichment process because 
\begin{inparaenum}[a)]
		\item it was designed as a standalone tool written in SWI-Prolog\footnote{\url{http://www.swi-prolog.org/} accessed 2018/04/30} and
		\item as input it only accepts the whole OWL~ontology 
\end{inparaenum}.
However, to make concept definitions and relations more understandable for non-experts, some revised rules were integrated in our enrichment process.

To illustrate the concept of neighboring nodes and how they relate to the Context Enrichment approach explained later, a simple ontology graph is given in~\hyperref[fig:simple_owl_graph]{Figure~\ref*{fig:simple_owl_graph}} describing the teacher/pupil domain.
\begin{figure}
	 \centering
	 \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{drawio/University_Ontology_Example}
	 \caption{Simple OWL ontology graph}\label{fig:simple_owl_graph}
\end{figure}
For example, if the concept \textit{:Teacher} is taken as reference node, it makes sense to not only consider the concept itself, but instead include connected nodes~(e.g. the concept \textit{:Person} and the object property \textit{:teaches}) in the enrichment process. 

As in the guidelines for conducting crowdsourcing research~\cite{sarasua2015crowdsourcing}, the authors recommended to avoid technical terms in crowdsourcing questions. To facilitate this need, we examined an existing approach on ontology verbalisation and how they could be integrated in the Context Enrichment process. 

Despite the fact that natural language is desirable for descriptions as everybody knows and understands it with no extra learning effort, it conflicts with highly expressive, domain specific and formal knowledge representations. Formally specified ontologies on the other hand facilitate encoding complex relations in domain-specific areas. To resolve this conflict, the new language variant \textbf{ACE}~\textit{(Attempto Controlled English)}~\cite{fuchs2008} was proposed. ACE is a formal language, capable of expressing domain-specific knowledge with a well-defined syntax, supporting formal reasoning and readable by specialists who are yet unfamiliar with formal languages and methods.

As our approach described later in this section is based on ACE\footnote{\url{https://tinyurl.com/yc3zhu9a} accessed 2018/05/05}\footnote{\url{https://tinyurl.com/ycst39jv} accessed 2018/05/05}, a short overview of ACE' language structure is given in the following paragraphs:
 
 \paragraph{Simple Sentences} A Simple Sentence derived from standard English contains a subject and a verb:
 
$ subject \quad + \quad verb \quad + \quad complements \quad [ \quad + \quad adjuncts \quad ] $

In addition the verb relate direct or indirect to one or more other objects~(\textit{complements}). Optionally, to add more specificity one or more adverbs and prepositional phrases can be added~(\textit{adjuncts}). 

\paragraph{Composite Sentences} A Composite Sentence is recursively built from one or more Simple Sentences connected by \textit{coordination},
\textit{subordination}, \textit{quantification} and \textit{negation}. Whereas, coordination is associates sentences either by the word \texttt{and} or \texttt{or}, subordination describes dependent sentences in some form of relation to each other~(e.g. if-then sentences). Quantification enables expressing statements about all~(universal quantification) or certain~(existential quantification) objects of a certain domain. Last, negation is a way encode negative polarity in a sentence~(e.g. sentences containing \texttt{not} or \texttt{no}). 

\paragraph{Query Sentences} Query Sentences can be divided into polar questions~(e.g. with \textit{yes/no} answer) and non-polar questions, also known as \emph{wh-questions}. For those there does not exist a pre-defined answer, as in contrast to the former yes/no questions. Furthermore, wh-questions start with either of the following five W-words: \texttt{Who}, \texttt{What}, \texttt{When}, \texttt{Where} and \texttt{Why}. However, sometimes questions starting with the word \texttt{How} are added to the category of wh-questions.

\paragraph{Anaphoric References} In case the meaning of a word or phrase depends on the context, multiple occurrences of these expressions are called \textit{Anaphoric References}. More specifically, the referring term~(\textit{anaphor}) relates to an antecedent expression. For example in the sentence \texttt{Tom arrived, but nobody noticed him}, the pronoun \texttt{him} relates to \texttt{Tom}. To resolve ambiguities during the processing phase, Anaphoric References are replaced by encoded references. 

Among others, one application areas of ACE is \textit{OWL Verbalizer}~\cite{stevens2011}, an open source tool\footnote{\url{http://mcs.open.ac.uk/nlg/SWAT/Verbaliser.html} accessed 2018/04/30} aiming at producing ACE texts from generic OWL ontologies. A description on the major concepts of OWL Verbaliser where our approach is based on is given below:

To overcome the burden of manual authoring ontology definitions, the tool formally known as OWL Verbaliser and now part of the SWAT Tool Suite\footnote{\url{http://mcs.open.ac.uk/nlg/SWAT/} accessed 2018/05/06} was created. \hyperref[fig:verbaliser_architecture]{Figure~\ref*{fig:verbaliser_architecture}} shows the conceptual architecture of the verbaliser.
