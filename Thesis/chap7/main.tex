\chapter{Results}\label{chap:results}
Based on the metrics discussed in \hyperref[sec:evaluation_metrics]{Section~\ref*{sec:evaluation_metrics}}, this chapter highlights the results of our evaluation.
This chapter is divided along the datasets we used for evaluation, that is, \hyperref[sec:result_cc_ontology]{Section~\ref*{sec:result_cc_ontology}} covers the \emph{climate~change} domain, \hyperref[sec:result_f_ontology]{Section~\ref*{sec:result_f_ontology}} is dedicated to \emph{finance} and \emph{tennis} is handled in \hyperref[sec:result_t_ontology]{Section~\ref*{sec:result_t_ontology}}. Finally, an overall \emph{comparison} of all evaluation domains is done in \hyperref[sec:result_comparison]{Section~\ref*{sec:result_comparison}}.
