	Validating the relevance of ontologies is considered an important task in the Semantic Web Lifecycle. This holds especially for 
	learned ontologies which contain quite naturally a lot of errors. Although many errors can be solved algorithmically, solving more complex problems
	by machines becomes very hard if not impossible. Crowdsourcing offers a cost effective alternative in which tasks were solved by a large group of
	human workers. However, the performance of existing approaches that combine ontology validation with Crowdsourcing is still not satisfying.
	
	A promising way of tackling this problem is to enrich Crowdsourcing tasks with additional information to improve its understanding. 
	This \emph{Context} has not only a positive impact on the crowd's performance but also raises the result quality.
